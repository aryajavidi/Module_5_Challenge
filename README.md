### Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create and visualize a dataframe that will show ride sharing data by city type, split between rural, urban, and suburban areas. 
Based on this data, we created a multiple line graph that would allow us to identify total weekly fares by each city type. After gathering this data, we sorted it and formatted it in tables and created visuals that would display our findings. 

This data and the visualizations we created can be used to propose interventions or ideas to ride sharing businesses to identify and implement different startegies to maximize profits based on locations and time of the year. 

### Results

Among the different city types, we were able to identify that Urban areas are the most profitable for ridesharing fares, followed by suburban areas and lastly rural areas. This data would lead us to the conclusion that profits for ride sharing companies can be linked to population and population density, as urban areas are generally much more densely populated and may have fewer drivers. 

While urban areas have a higher number of rides, rural and suburban areas have higher average fares per ride. This can likely be attributed to the spread and population density of these areas. A ride from location A to location B in a rural area may be two or three times farther than the distance of a ride throigh the city. 
Rural areas saw the fewest number of drivers but had the highest average fare per driver and per ride. Travel time and distance in rural areas are likely longer, making the average fare per ride & driver the most out of all city types.

### Summary

Basedon the information we have recieved from this analysis, I would recommend three changes to improve the profits of the rideshare companies.
The first, I would have urban drivers charge more per mile or perhaps a flat rate to start with since trips are likely to be significantly shorter than in suburban and rural areas. 
Second, I would increase the number of drivers in Urban areas as the demand is the highest in urban areas. 
Lastly, I would increase the number of drivers in all three types of locations during the end of feburary, where we are able to see a spike in fares for all three areas. This seems to be a time in which more people are using ride share services and could be adjusted accordingly.
